<p>
</p>

> <h4>The Java Swing and Servlet Applications project focuses on creating user-friendly and interactive interfaces using Java Swing for various applications, including Login Pages, Application Forms, and Student Details. The project also explores advanced Java concepts by integrating Java Servlets for server-side logic, ensuring seamless backend processing.</h4>

> <h4>A creative feature was developed to simulate a human face using Swing, showcasing the capability of Swing components to build engaging visuals. Additionally, interactive social media buttons were implemented to enhance the user experience. The project highlights proficiency in both front-end design (Swing) and back-end integration (Java Servlets), making it a full-stack Java-based application.</h4>
