## Project Description

This project demonstrates the creation of **user-friendly interfaces** using **Java Swing** for various applications like **Login Pages**, **Application Forms**, and **Student Details**. It also integrates **Java Servlets** to manage server-side logic and backend data processing.

A standout feature of the project is a **human face simulation** created using Swing, showcasing Swing components' visual capabilities. Additionally, **interactive social media buttons** were implemented to enhance user interaction.

The project highlights expertise in both **front-end development** (Swing) and **back-end integration** (Java Servlets), making it a comprehensive **full-stack Java application**.

## Features

- **Login Page:** Secure login functionality with form validation.
- **Application Form:** Collect user data via interactive forms.
- **Student Details:** View and manage student information.
- **Human Face Simulation:** Feature simulating a human face using Swing components.
- **Social Media Buttons:** Interactive buttons linking to social media platforms.
- **Server-side Integration:** Backend processing and data management using **Java Servlets**.
